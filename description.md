Fasta AI_CSI R1 is a semantic inference module developed to address the challenge of assigning accurate country-level metadata to avian influenza virus sequences when rule-based ISO 3166-1 matching fails. The module uses OpenAI language models (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4o) to interpret ambiguous geographic strings through a prompt-based interface, enabling inference for informal names (e.g., "Yilan", "Guangdong") that would otherwise be labeled as "Other".

Implemented in Python, the tool includes batch inference, rate-limit handling, autosave/resume functions, and cumulative dictionary updates. Outputs include AI-inferred mappings (`location_to_country_AI.json`), unresolved cases for review (`other_locations.csv`), and final statistics for downstream use. This solution supports large-scale metadata normalization workflows in influenza surveillance, ensuring better accuracy and traceability.
